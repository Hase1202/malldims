# Comprehensive Tiered Pricing System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive tiered pricing system for the Beauty Product IMS that addresses all the requirements you specified. The system supports 7 pricing tiers, dynamic transaction pricing, price overrides, and multiple cost prices for the same item.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Seven-Tier Pricing Structure
- **Regional Distributor (RD)** - Highest tier
- **Provincial Distributor (PD)** - Second tier  
- **District Distributor (DD)** - Third tier
- **City Distributor (CD)** - Fourth tier
- **Reseller (RS)** - Fifth tier
- **Sub-Reseller (Sub-RS)** - Sixth tier
- **Suggested Retail Price (SRP)** - Lowest tier for end customers

### 2. Dynamic Transaction Pricing
- **User Cost Tier Restriction**: Users can only sell at tiers below their own purchase tier
- **Automatic Tier Validation**: System prevents users from selling at their own tier or higher
- **Real-time Price Calculation**: Prices are calculated based on user's cost tier and available inventory batches

### 3. Price Overrides & Discounts
- **Percentage Discounts**: Track when items are purchased with a percentage discount from standard tier price
- **Fixed Amount Discounts**: Support for fixed dollar amount discounts
- **Override Benefits**: Users who purchase with discounts can sell at their original tier price
- **Effective Cost Tracking**: System calculates the actual cost after discounts

### 4. Multiple Cost Prices (Batch System)
- **Batch-Specific Costing**: Each inventory batch has its own cost price and tier
- **FIFO Support**: Batches are ordered by expiry date and creation date for FIFO management
- **Batch Selection**: Users can select which cost batch to sell from during transactions
- **Profit Tracking**: Detailed profit calculations per batch and transaction

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Models Enhanced

#### 1. ItemPricing Model
```python
class ItemPricing(models.Model):
    # All 7 pricing tiers with validation
    regional_distributor = models.DecimalField(...)
    provincial_distributor = models.DecimalField(...)
    district_distributor = models.DecimalField(...)
    city_distributor = models.DecimalField(...)
    reseller = models.DecimalField(...)
    sub_reseller = models.DecimalField(...)
    srp = models.DecimalField(...)
    
    # Pricing hierarchy validation
    def validate_pricing_hierarchy(self):
        # Ensures RD >= PD >= DD >= CD >= RS >= SUB >= SRP
```

#### 2. InventoryBatch Model (Enhanced)
```python
class InventoryBatch(models.Model):
    # Batch identification
    batch_number = models.CharField(...)
    item = models.ForeignKey(Item, ...)
    
    # Cost and tier information
    cost_price = models.DecimalField(...)
    cost_tier = models.CharField(choices=PRICING_TIER_CHOICES)
    
    # Discount tracking
    tier_discount_percentage = models.DecimalField(...)
    tier_discount_amount = models.DecimalField(...)
    
    # Quantity management
    initial_quantity = models.IntegerField(...)
    quantity_available = models.IntegerField(...)
    quantity_reserved = models.IntegerField(...)
    
    # FIFO management
    expiry_date = models.DateField(...)
    purchase_date = models.DateField(...)
    
    # Smart pricing logic
    @property
    def effective_cost_price(self):
        # Calculates actual cost after discounts
    
    @property
    def can_sell_at_tier(self):
        # Determines sellable tiers based on cost and discounts
```

#### 3. BatchSale Model (New)
```python
class BatchSale(models.Model):
    # Tracks sales from specific batches
    batch = models.ForeignKey(InventoryBatch, ...)
    inventory_change = models.ForeignKey(InventoryChange, ...)
    quantity_sold = models.IntegerField()
    sale_price_per_unit = models.DecimalField(...)
    cost_price_per_unit = models.DecimalField(...)
    
    # Auto-calculated profit metrics
    profit_per_unit = models.DecimalField(...)
    total_profit = models.DecimalField(...)
```

#### 4. Account Model (Enhanced)
```python
class Account(AbstractUser):
    # User's purchase tier
    cost_tier = models.CharField(choices=PRICING_TIER_CHOICES[:-1])
    
    def get_allowed_selling_tiers(self):
        # Returns tiers user can sell at (below their cost tier)
```

### API Endpoints Added

#### 1. Item Pricing Management
- `GET/POST /api/item-pricing/` - Manage item pricing
- `GET /api/item-pricing/{id}/get_prices_for_user/` - Get available prices for user
- `GET /api/item-pricing/get_user_allowed_tiers/` - Get user's allowed selling tiers

#### 2. Inventory Batch Management  
- `GET/POST /api/inventory-batches/` - Manage inventory batches
- `GET /api/inventory-batches/fifo_batches/?item_id={id}` - Get FIFO ordered batches
- `POST /api/inventory-batches/{id}/reserve_quantity/` - Reserve quantity from batch
- `POST /api/inventory-batches/{id}/release_reservation/` - Release reserved quantity

#### 3. Batch Sales Tracking
- `GET/POST /api/batch-sales/` - Track batch-specific sales
- `GET /api/batch-sales/profit_analysis/` - Get profit analysis across batches

#### 4. Customer Special Pricing
- `GET/POST /api/customer-special-prices/` - Manage special customer pricing
- `POST /api/customer-special-prices/{id}/approve/` - Approve special pricing
- `POST /api/customer-special-prices/{id}/reject/` - Reject special pricing

### Frontend Components Created

#### 1. ItemPricingPage.tsx
- **Purpose**: Manage 7-tier pricing for individual items
- **Features**:
  - Visual pricing hierarchy with validation
  - Real-time hierarchy validation
  - Price comparison across tiers
  - Active/inactive pricing management

#### 2. ItemBatchesPage.tsx  
- **Purpose**: Manage inventory batches with enhanced costing
- **Features**:
  - Batch creation with cost tier and discount tracking
  - FIFO visualization with expiry management
  - Quantity tracking (available, reserved, sold)
  - Profit analysis per batch

## Business Logic Implementation

### 1. Pricing Rules Enforcement
```typescript
// User can only sell at tiers below their cost tier
const allowedTiers = user.cost_tier === 'PD' 
  ? ['DD', 'CD', 'RS', 'SUB', 'SRP'] 
  : [];

// Exception: If purchased with discount, can sell at original tier
const canSellAtOriginalTier = batch.tier_discount_percentage > 0 || 
                             batch.tier_discount_amount > 0;
```

### 2. FIFO Management
```python
# Batches ordered for FIFO
batches = InventoryBatch.objects.filter(
    item_id=item_id,
    batch_status='Active',
    quantity_available__gt=0
).order_by('expiry_date', 'created_at')
```

### 3. Profit Calculation
```python
# Auto-calculated on save
profit_per_unit = sale_price - cost_price_from_batch
profit_margin = (profit_per_unit / cost_price) * 100
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Creating Item Pricing
1. Navigate to inventory item
2. Click "Manage Pricing" 
3. Set prices for each tier (RD highest, SRP lowest)
4. System validates hierarchy automatically
5. Save pricing configuration

### 2. Adding Inventory Batches
1. Go to item batches page
2. Click "Add Batch"
3. Specify cost tier and actual cost price
4. Add discounts if applicable (percentage or fixed amount)
5. Set quantities and dates
6. System calculates effective cost price

### 3. Making Sales (Future Implementation)
1. Select item to sell
2. System shows available batches in FIFO order
3. Choose batch and quantity to sell
4. System shows allowed selling tiers for user
5. Select selling tier and customer
6. System calculates profit automatically

## Database Migration Applied
