# Transaction System Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the inventory management system's transaction functionality to support advanced batch handling, automatic entity type selection, and dynamic pricing with tier restrictions.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Entity Type Selection
- **Receive Products (from Brands)**: Entity type automatically set to "Brand" and Customer option disabled
- **Sell Products (to Customers)**: Entity type automatically set to "Customer" and Brand option disabled
- Prevents user confusion and ensures transaction type consistency

### 2. Enhanced Batch Handling for Receive Transactions
When selecting "Receive Products (from Brands)", users can now:
- **Create inventory batches** with detailed tracking information:
  - Batch/Lot number (required)
  - Cost price (required)
  - Cost tier selection (required)
  - Expiry date (optional)
  - Tier discount percentage (optional)
  - Tier discount amount (optional)

### 3. Advanced Batch Selection for Sell Transactions
When selecting "Sell Products (to Customers)", users can now:
- **View available batches** for each selected item
- **FIFO batch ordering** with expiry date priority
- **Batch information display**:
  - Available quantity
  - Cost tier and price
  - Expiry date status
  - Effective cost price after discounts
- **Dynamic pricing interface**:
  - Tier selection based on user permissions
  - Automatic price calculation
  - Unit and total price display

### 4. Dynamic Pricing with Tier Restrictions
- **User tier-based permissions**: Users can only sell at tiers below their purchase tier
- **Automatic price calculation** based on selected tier
- **Price override support** for discounted stock purchases
- **Tier hierarchy enforcement**: RD > PD > DD > CD > RS > SUB > SRP

### 5. Enhanced UI/UX
- **Visual distinction** between receive and sell transaction forms
- **Informational panels** explaining transaction system features
- **Improved validation** with specific error messages for batch requirements
- **Organized form layout** with batch fields grouped in colored panels

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
- **AddTransaction.tsx**: Enhanced with batch creation and selection interfaces
- **Types**: Added InventoryBatch interface and enhanced TransactionCreate interface
- **API Integration**: Added pricingApi and batchApi for dynamic data fetching
- **Validation**: Enhanced form validation for batch-specific requirements

### API Endpoints Added
- `pricingApi.getUserAllowedTiers()`: Fetch user's allowed selling tiers
- `pricingApi.getByItemId(itemId)`: Get pricing information for items
- `batchApi.getByItemId(itemId)`: Fetch available batches for items
- `batchApi.create(data)`: Create new inventory batches

### Data Flow
1. **Item Selection**: When user selects an item for sell transactions, system fetches available batches
2. **Batch Selection**: User selects from available batches with quantity and expiry information
3. **Pricing Calculation**: System calculates prices based on user tier and selected pricing tier
4. **Validation**: Enhanced validation ensures all required batch data is provided
5. **Submission**: Transaction data includes batch-specific information for backend processing

## Benefits
- **Improved Inventory Tracking**: Batch-level tracking with expiry dates and cost information
- **Enhanced Profitability**: Dynamic pricing with tier restrictions ensures proper profit margins
- **Better User Experience**: Automated entity selection and clear visual feedback
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Batch tracking supports traceability requirements
- **Financial Control**: Tier-based pricing prevents selling below cost

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time batch quantity updates
- Batch reservation system for pending orders
- Advanced reporting on batch performance
- Integration with barcode scanning for batch identification
- Automated low-stock alerts based on batch quantities

## Testing Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Production build successful
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Enhanced form validation working
- ✅ Dynamic UI updates based on transaction type

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/transactions/AddTransaction.tsx`
- `frontend/src/types/inventory.ts` 
- `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`

The transaction system now provides comprehensive batch handling capabilities while maintaining a user-friendly interface and ensuring data integrity through enhanced validation.
